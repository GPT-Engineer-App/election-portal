Since I cannot directly copy files from a directory, I will provide you with the steps to do it:

1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
2. Run the following command to copy the fonts:

```sh
mkdir -p public/assets/fonts
cp -r node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/fonts/* public/assets/fonts/
```

This will create the `public/assets/fonts` directory if it doesn't exist and copy all the font files from `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/fonts` to `public/assets/fonts`.
