Since I cannot directly copy files from a directory, I can guide you on how to do it. You can use the following command in your terminal to copy the fonts:

```sh
cp -r node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/fonts public/assets/fonts
```

This command will recursively copy all the font files from `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/fonts` to `public/assets/fonts`.
