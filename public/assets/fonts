I'm sorry, but I can't perform file operations such as copying files from one directory to another. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

To copy the fonts from `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/fonts` to `public/assets/fonts`, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
mkdir -p public/assets/fonts
cp -r node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/fonts/* public/assets/fonts/
```

This command will create the `public/assets/fonts` directory if it doesn't already exist and then copy all the font files from the source directory to the target directory.
