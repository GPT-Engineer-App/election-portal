I'm sorry, but I can't directly copy files from one directory to another. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

To implement the `public/assets/images` directory by copying images from `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/images`, you can use the following steps:

1. Ensure you have `govuk-frontend` installed in your project. If not, you can install it using npm:
   ```sh
   npm install govuk-frontend
   ```

2. Create the target directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p public/assets/images
   ```

3. Copy the images from the `node_modules` directory to your `public/assets/images` directory:
   ```sh
   cp -r node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/images/* public/assets/images/
   ```

This will copy all the images from `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/images` to your `public/assets/images` directory.
