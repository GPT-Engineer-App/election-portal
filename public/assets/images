I'm sorry, but I can't perform file operations like copying files from one directory to another. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

To copy the images from `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/images` to `public/assets/images`, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
mkdir -p public/assets/images
cp -r node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/images/* public/assets/images/
```

This command will create the `public/assets/images` directory if it doesn't already exist and then copy all the images from the source directory to the target directory.
